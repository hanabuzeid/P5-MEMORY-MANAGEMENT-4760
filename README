CS4760 Project 6: Memory Management

##### DESCRIPTION
This program is designed to demonstrate how memory
is managed in an operating sys. The OS simulator
will start by initializing IPC resources and determine
which request schm to use in the user processes. The
LRU page replacement algorithm will be used when there is
full memory. For the request schemes (random or weighted),
the overall goal is to generate the fewest number of overall
page faults. The most realistic model is the weighted request
schm because it is more likely to request addresses from
lower-indexed pages, so the chances the request of a page
not being in memory is significantly less.
